# CHicago

CHicago is a portable operating system developed from scratch. The code is in C/C++ (+ a bit of assembly).

# Building

Run make on the root directory (or in the directory of the project you want to build, though in that case you need to make sure you already ran make in the toolchain folder).
View the makefile for the avaliable flags/modifiers (TODO: Also document it here).
